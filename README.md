# *AI UNIVERSITY NEWS GENERATOR*

## *Problem Statement*
Students struggle to stay informed on university updates due to fragmented and overwhelming information from diverse sources like social media and bulletins. A unified solution is needed to deliver concise, personalized, real-time news tailored to their interests, enhancing campus engagement and accessibility.

---

## *Background*
University campuses are dynamic environments where timely access to relevant updates is essential. Existing tools fail to offer a unified, personalized news delivery system tailored for university ecosystems. This project addresses this gap by leveraging AI technologies for efficient information aggregation and dissemination.

## *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation*
The *AI University News Generator* leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine semantic search and generative AI for delivering highly relevant and personalized news updates.

### Key Components:
1. *Data Collection and Preprocessing*:
   - Aggregates data from multiple sources, including university websites, local news outlets, social media, and RSS feeds.
   - Uses tools like *Google Cloud Document AI* for document parsing and cleaning.
   - Preprocessed data is chunked into smaller segments for efficient indexing.

2. *Vector Database Integration*:
   - Converts preprocessed data into semantic embeddings using advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4).
   - Stores embeddings in a vector database such as *Milvus, **Pinecone, **Qdrant, or **Weaviate* for efficient retrieval.

3. *Query Processing*:
   - Processes user queries via LLMs to generate embeddings.
   - Embeddings are used to retrieve relevant information from the vector database.
   - Retrieved data is passed back to the LLM for content generation.

4. *News Generation*:
   - Combines retrieved information with generative AI to produce concise, accurate, and context-aware updates.
   - Covers diverse topics, including academic announcements, safety alerts, and cultural events.

5. *Interactive Frontend*:
   - Developed using *Streamlit* to allow students to input queries, view updates, and upload custom documents for analysis.

6. *Automation with Pipelines*:
   - Integrates *Apache Airflow* to manage real-time data ingestion pipelines, ensuring updates are current and efficient.
